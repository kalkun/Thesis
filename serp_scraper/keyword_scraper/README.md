### Scraper

This code defines a commandline interface for scraping images.

Get usage information:
```
python keyword_scraper.py --help
```
Otherwise the general idea is to provide a path to a directory where the images
scraped will be saved, the key word to be scraped (currently supports only one)
and the search engines (currently only supports google). Look in the help for 
additional arguments
```
python keyword_scraper.py data potato google
```
